# Animated Globe

## Creating Project
I use a public generated template for unity projects, you can find it on my github account. After you create a new repository you can clone the project onto your ssd.

## Importing it to unity
In the UnityHub chose the option import project from Hard Disk and chose the project you cloned from your github account.
